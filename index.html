        <h2>Happy Tree Friends</h2>
      <p>Happy Tree Friends is a parody of a television show (e.g. Tiny Toon Adventures, Peanuts). All the characters are
      anthropomorphic mammals, and they all (with the exception of Lumpy, Sniffles, and Buddhist Monkey) have two front buck
      teeth and heart-shaped noses. In early episodes, most characters played the roles of children playing childish games.
      However, as the series progressed, the age concept was dropped, and now characters act variously like children,
      teenagers, and adults in different episodes. The only characters who are unaffected by this concept are Pop and Cub, who always act like an adult and a child respectively, and characters whose roles usually are not affected by age, such as
      Splendid or Cro-Marmot.
      <br>
      At the beginning of each episode, the characters are typically found in everyday situations. However, these situations
      always escalate into violence, and the inevitable deaths of those involved and/or "innocent" bystanders, mostly because
      of very unfortunate, surprising accidents with otherwise harmless instruments. Some of the characters have mental
      illnesses, like Flippy, who has post-traumatic stress disorder from a war and will become a killer in certain situations
      (such as when balloons pop, which sounds like gunfire to him).</p>

        alt="Family Guy">
       <h2>Family Guy</h2> 
      <p>The show revolves around the adventures of the Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling and clumsy yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; Lois, a pretty stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the
      wealthy Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed or ignored by
      the family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, is simply a
      younger version of his father; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who is an
      adult-mannered evil genius and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking,
      martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog Brian, though he is still considered a pet in many
      ways.The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of
      metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>

        <h2>The Simpsons</h2>
      <p>The Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle.
      However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of
      Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having
      Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa's
      days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of
      education. The town features a vast array of television channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about the
      entertainment industry and the press.</p>

        <h2>Brickleberry</h2>
      <p>The show follows the misadventures of a group of National Park Service rangers in the fictional Brickleberry National
      Forest. Steve is the everyman of sorts, who consistently wins the "Ranger of the Month"
      award mainly by virtue of the fact that he actually attempts to do his job. In typical sitcom fashion, Steve's cozy
      little world is threatened when the attractive and reasonably competent Ethel joins the team.</p>

        <h2>Paradise PD</h2>
      <p>Paradise PD follows a small-town police department where crime is rampant and the police are seriously incompetent. The
      force consists of Chief Randall Crawford, the violent Gina Jabowski, the morbidly obese Dusty Marlow, the perverted
      senior citizen Stanley Hopson, the cowardly Gerald "Fitz" Fitzgerald, the addicted drug dog Bullet, and Crawford's son
      Kevin. The town is also home to many weird characters, including Crawford's ex-wife Karen, the hillbillies Robby and
      Delbert, Hobo Cop, Dr. Funtlicher, Preacher Paul, Terry Two-Toes, and his mom. Continuing arcs of the show include
      Gina's lust over Dusty, Kevin's wish to impress his father, Fitz's double life as a drug kingpin simply known as the
      Kingpin, and the Crawfords' wish to get back together.</p>
